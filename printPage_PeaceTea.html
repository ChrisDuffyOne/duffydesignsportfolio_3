			<span class="projectName">PEACE TEA SUSTAINABILITY CAMPAIGN</span>
			<span class="projectExp">Sustainability is the idea that any process whether it be biological or business should not take more out of an ecosystem than which can be replaced. Recently this has been becoming an important trend in the business world. Peace Tea is a brand whose built it image off of a nostalgic 1960s counter culture vibe so it's only reasonable that they would want to associate themselves with such a movement.

			The campaign is designed to promote internal awareness of the topic within the company. As a result a sub-brand "Peacing it Together" was created. To go along with the sub brand a storyboard for a motion graphic was created as well as a poster to be displayed in public areas and break rooms.</span>
